# Guess The Number Challenge

This felt super silly
Since the Ropsten testnet (which is the only network CTE supports) is no longer available, I had to do this exercise in a Hardhat environment.

## How to complete

Just deploy the contract with 1 ether and call `guess(uint8)` passing along 1 ether and with 42 as its parameter, which is the answer and is openly stored in a state variable ðŸ¤¦.
