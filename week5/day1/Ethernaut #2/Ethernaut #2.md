For this one, you need better eyes more than smarter brains.

## How to complete

Look closely enough to notice that the constructor name doesn't match the contract name, which makes it a normal function. It's `Fal1out` and the contract is `Fallout`.
So, just run `await contract.Fal1out()`, which will make you the owner and you'll clear the level.
